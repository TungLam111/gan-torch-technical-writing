# gan-torch-technical-writing

- project bayesian deep convolutional generative adversarial network with Differentiable augmentation for technical writing course. models are trained parallel to obtain FID + loss scores. 

- due to the lack of resources, we train on google colab + GPU

- all source code in under python language is merely implementation
